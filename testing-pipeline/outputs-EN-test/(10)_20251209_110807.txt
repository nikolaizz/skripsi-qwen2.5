The image shows a small store with a blue door and a counter inside. There are various items on display, including boxes and bags. The store is located under a canopy with trees in the background. The ground outside is paved with tiles. There is no immediate danger for visually impaired people, but the store's entrance is slightly raised, which might pose a challenge for those using a wheelchair or mobility aids.
