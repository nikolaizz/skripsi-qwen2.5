The image shows two people walking under a covered walkway. The walkway has a black and white striped pattern on the columns. The ground is paved with white tiles, and there are small pebbles on the sides. The walkway is surrounded by greenery, including trees and bushes. There is no visible danger for visually impaired people, as the walkway is well-lit and the columns are clearly marked.
