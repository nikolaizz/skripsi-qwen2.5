The image shows a person standing on a wooden plank that is partially submerged in water. The plank is placed over a small gap in the pavement. There is a red fire hydrant nearby. The area appears to be a garden or park with greenery and trees. The water is shallow and the person seems to be balancing on the plank. There is no immediate danger for visually impaired people, but they should be cautious of the water and the wooden plank.
