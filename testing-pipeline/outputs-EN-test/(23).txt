The image shows a green recycling bin with the word "Kleen" on it, placed on a wet, paved surface. The bin is partially open, revealing some items inside. There is a wooden bench next to the bin. The background includes a corrugated metal fence and some greenery. The ground appears to be wet, possibly from recent rain. There is no immediate danger for visually impaired people, but the wet surface might make it slippery.
